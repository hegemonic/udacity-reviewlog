Udacity Review Log
---------------------

Client tool to read the log of your reviews. [See it live](http://jaycode.github.io/udacity-reviewlog/).

You can find things like:

1. How much do you earn per month?
2. How many projects do you complete per month?
3. How productive are you? (How long does it take to complete a project, roughly?)
4. Nice charts of your earnings throughout the months.

All data are stored locally in your local storage system, so you don't need to
worry about providing your API token. To verify this, open "inspect element" feature
from your browser and record your network activity (view "Network" tab) as you enter some random API code or pulling 
review data.
